## The main vision, idea, area (etc.)

Our goal is to create a machine learning algorithm which can recommend tracks to mix, which are complementary with each-other. Additionally, we would like to provide search/filter functionality. 



## A deeper rationale of the project

DJs and casual hobbyists keep a list of tracks to mix. From their tastes and through reading the room, they mix tracks accordingly. Our goal is to provide a utility, which recommends pieces which may streamline a DJ's workflow. For performers, this would be a realtime utility, which would assist them as they sifted through their track list. It would also help aspiring mixers build out their library. We will do this through machine learning algorithms and general search criteria. In a way, we will be programming 'taste' into a utility. Our algorithm must learn what works, in order to aid the DJ and possibly eliminate options. This will make a DJ's final say easier.










## Description of the business need or opportunity (innovation) that we envision

As stated in our golden circle, this would aid hobbyists and performers, while maintaining a level of needed oversight to ensure quality. If an algorithm can predict complementary tracks. This could provide users with inspiration, or solutions to those with less musical familiarity or means.








## Msc.
We have spoken with professor Yow in a private meeting, and given that our project is on machine learning, would very much like to have him as our mentor. He is easily our number 1 choice. It seems like a sensible arrangement.
