## The main vision, idea, area (etc.)

Our goal is to create a machine learning algorithm which can recommend track to mix, which are complementary to eachother. Aditionally, we would like to automate this process by providing a sample of the tracks mixed together.



## A deeper rationale of the project

DJs and casual hobbiests keep a list of tracks to mix. From their tastes and through reading the room, they mix tracks accordingly. Our goal is to provide a utility, which recommends like pieces which may streamline a DJ's workflow. For performers, this would be a realtime utility, which would assist them as they sifted through their track list. It would also help aspiring mixers build out their library. We will do this through machine learning algorithms and general search criteria. In a way, we will be programming 'taste' into a utility. Our algorithm must learn what works, in order to aid the DJ and possibly eliminate options. This will make a DJ's final say easier. 









## Description of the business need or opportunity (innovation) that we envision


As stated in our golden circle, this would aid hobbiests and performers, while maintaing a level of needed oversight to ensure quality. We will of course attempt to generate samples of mixed audio - although this is simply to see how far we can stretch the technology. If an algorithm can predict complementary tracks, why not attempt the implementation aswell? This could provide users with inspiration, or solutions to those with less musical familiarity or means. 







## Msc.
We have spoken with professor Yow in a private meeting, and given that our project is on machine learning, would very much like to have him as our mentor. He is easily our number 1 choice. It seems like a sensible arrangement.
