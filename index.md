## We're Helping Artists 

Often times, a DJ will manage a library of songs - curating a list that will mix well together. From their tastes and by reading the room, they mix tracks accordingly. Our goal is to provide a utility, which recommends ideal candidates - this may streamline a DJ's workflow. For performers, this would be an on-the-job utility; assisting creators as they sifted through a track list. It would also help aspiring mixers build out their library. We aim to acomplish this, through machine learning algorithms and general search criteria. While the final decision comes down to the artist, our application will eliminate unlikely candidates & make coming to a decision easier.
